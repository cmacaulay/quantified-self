# Quantified Self - [Front End](https://cmacaulay.github.io/quantifieâ€¦)
Quantified self is a basic meal calorie tracker, that allows you to track the amount of calories you've eaten per meal, per day.

The landing page is always set to the current day, and allows you to add foods you've eaten to each meal (including snacks!). You're able to search through all of the foods saved in the database, and when you select "Add New Food" it redirects you to the foods page.

The foods page is very straight forward, and allows you to add new foods to the database. There is a button that enables you to navigate back to the meals page.

This front end is built using the [Quantified Self API](https://github.com/cmacaulay/quantified-self-api/blob/master/README.md); a Node.js(v7.2.1)/Express app that uses PostgresQL and knex.
